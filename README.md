# Multiclass-Perceptron
In the online setting, learning takes place in a sequential order and at each step . At each step, the learner makes a prediction or take some action, each of which can potentially result in some loss, and the goal is to update the prediction/decision model at the end of each step so as to minimize the total loss over a sequence of trials. So far, many online learning algorithms have been discussed. Perceptron algorithm is one of them. A lot of literature is available related to 2-class Perceptron algorithm but only few focus on Multi- Class Perceptron algorithm which is one of the natural extension of 2-class. In the present study, we focus on Multi-Class Perceptron algorithm and propose a new update rule and compare the results with the existing rules based on stability of norm of weights and the number of mistakes made by the algorithm.
